# __Constants Usage Guidelines__
This document provides guidelines for using constants within the application, focusing on the organization, definition, and usage of constants to ensure code consistency, readability, and maintainability.


## Overview
Constants are used throughout the application to represent fixed values that are significant across various modules, such as table names, error messages, and other reusable static values. Proper handling of these constants reduces the likelihood of errors and simplifies modifications or refactoring.

## Defining Constants

_Organization_

- __Centralize Constant Definitions__: Group related constants in specific files within a constants directory. For example, database table names can be stored in TABLES.js, while common error messages can be in ERROR_MSGS.js.

_Naming Conventions_

- __Upper Snake Case__: Define constant names using uppercase letters with underscores as separators (e.g., USER_TABLE, ERROR_NOT_FOUND).

- __Descriptive Names__: Ensure names clearly describe the constant's purpose or value, making the code self-documenting.
Structure

- __Use Objects for Grouping__: When related constants can be grouped together, use an object to encapsulate them. This approach is particularly useful for organizing table names, API response messages, or configuration settings.





# __Codebase Maintenance Guidelines__
This document outlines best practices and guidelines for maintaining consistency and readability across the application's codebase. By adhering to these principles, developers can ensure a well-organized, efficient, and collaborative development environment.

## Project Structure

- Modular Design: Organize the codebase into modules or components based on functionality. Each module should encapsulate a specific aspect of the application's functionality.

- Directory Naming: Use clear, descriptive names for directories and files. For instance, store utility functions in a utils directory within their respective module directories.

- Create the helper functions within the directory that is specific to it. For example `users/utils/helper.js` this is the utils file that has only users related helper functions.
